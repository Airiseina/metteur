//! Static harness prompt sections.
//!
//! The texts live in `prompts/*.md` and are embedded at compile time, so a
//! released binary always carries the exact prompt revision it was built with.
//! Editing a section is a prompt change: it invalidates the stored prefix of
//! running sessions once, by design (see `HarnessPrompt::refresh`).
//!
//! Priorities decide the rendered order (higher first) and are grouped by how
//! often each section can change, so a change invalidates as little of the
//! provider prefix cache as possible: compiled-in rules first, then
//! per-session facts, then per-call instructions.
